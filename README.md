# Reinforcement Learning Papers Notes
Notes on many interesting RL papers. Also some of the notes are a little messy because these were my personal notes to start off with but most of them should be a pretty understandable summary.

### Important:
Most of the papers on this list were found through [Deep Reinforcement Learning: An Overview](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07274.pdf) which is a great source by Yuxi Li. The grouping also follows this source quite heavily.

## Preliminary Papers to Read
I don't include notes for these papers or topics because there are plenty of resources around the web to help understand them, including in [Deep Reinforcement Learning: An Overview](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07274.pdf)
